Question: design possible result ourcom saqa Dear tshingombe

 

Section 29(a) of the Policy and Criteria for Evaluating Foreign Qualifications within the South African NQF, as amended (March 2017) stipulates the requirements that a foreign awarding institution must meet for its qualifications to be recognised.

 

SAQA bases the advice below on information currently available to it.  SAQA reserves the right to change this advice should new authoritative information come to its attention.

 

Our online application document stipulates the following in terms of schooling qualifications:

"SAQA accepts only school leaving qualifications issued by the official examining / certification body in the country of origin, and not by the school, where based on external examinations.

No Certificates of Evaluation will be issued for school leaving documents other than those in respect of completed, national school exit qualifications issued by the relevant authorities."

Therefore, only school leaving qualifications correctly awarded by the authorised national examination body in the Democratic Republic of Congo will be recognised and not school leaving documents issued by the school itself.

Please note the purpose of this overseas institutions email is to give people some direction regarding accredited and non-accredited foreign institutions for the purpose of recognition and acceptance by SAQA for foreign qualifications evaluation.

 

Kind regards

Authentication Services

SAQA

 

The National Qualifications Framework (NQF) Act 67 of 2008 mandates SAQA to provide a foreign qualifications evaluation and advisory service, which it does in accordance with the Policy and Criteria for Evaluating Foreign Qualifications within the South African NQF, as amended (March 2017). Section 29(a) of the Policy and Criteria stipulates the requirements that a foreign awarding institution must meet for its qualifications to be recognised. (10 points)

    27.Question: explanation -         The resistance of the heating element

    -         I=  , p=i.v  , i=1,6/220 + 16000/220=7,27 , r=v/I = 220/7,27 = 30,26

    -         When a 12 volt lamp is connected a cross the correct supply voltage its power consumption is 60 watts determine  the rated

    -         The rated current and  , =60/12=5A ,

    -         The resistance of the filament R=12/5=2,4

    A lamp filament has resistance of 121 ohms and draws a current of 0, 91 ampere when connected across a certain supply determine,

    The power consumed by the lamp and 100,2w

    The supply voltage, v=r.xi (121x0, 91) =110, 11

    P=110x0, 91=100, 2

    -the open circuit e.m.f circuit, e.m.f of certain cell was measured and  fond to be 1,48 volts when a 2 ohm resistance was connected  across the terminals a current flow of , 0,6 amperes was  measured determine , the internal resitance of cell- ,the terminal ,voltage with ,the 2 ohm resistor connected 

    - Solution :  given  E=1,48 v ,R =2ohm , I = 0,6a ,    v=e/I –r ,, v=e-ir= 1,48-0,6x0,467= 1,48-0,28=1,2v Single line text.

    72.Question: design possible result ourcom saqa Dear tshingombe

     

    Section 29(a) of the Policy and Criteria for Evaluating Foreign Qualifications within the South African NQF, as amended (March 2017) stipulates the requirements that a foreign awarding institution must meet for its qualifications to be recognised.

     

    SAQA bases the advice below on information currently available to it.  SAQA reserves the right to change this advice should new authoritative information come to its attention.

     

    Our online application document stipulates the following in terms of schooling qualifications:

    "SAQA accepts only school leaving qualifications issued by the official examining / certification body in the country of origin, and not by the school, where based on external examinations.

    No Certificates of Evaluation will be issued for school leaving documents other than those in respect of completed, national school exit qualifications issued by the relevant authorities."

    Therefore, only school leaving qualifications correctly awarded by the authorised national examination body in the Democratic Republic of Congo will be recognised and not school leaving documents issued by the school itself.

    Please note the purpose of this overseas institutions email is to give people some direction regarding accredited and non-accredited foreign institutions for the purpose of recognition and acceptance by SAQA for foreign qualifications evaluation.

     

    Kind regards

    Authentication Services

    SAQA

     

    The National Qualifications Framework (NQF) Act 67 of 2008 mandates SAQA to provide a foreign qualifications evaluation and advisory service, which it does in accordance with the Policy and Criteria for Evaluating Foreign Qualifications within the South African NQF, as amended (March 2017).
